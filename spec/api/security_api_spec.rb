  # Returns a list of all securities available. Delisted securities included.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :active When true, return securities that are active. When false, return securities that are not active. A security is considered active if it has traded or has had a corporate action in the past 30 days, and has not been merged into another security (such as due to ticker changes or corporate restructurings).
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :delisted When true, return securities that have been delisted from their exchange. Note that there may be a newer security for the same company that has been relisted on a differente exchange. When false, return securities that have not been delisted.
  # @option opts [String] :code Return securities classified with the given code (&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://docs.intrinio.com/documentation/security_codes\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;).

  # @option opts [String] :ticker Return securities traded with the given ticker. Note that securities across the world (and through time) may trade with the same ticker but represent different companies. Use this in conjuction with other parameters for more specificity.
  # @option opts [String] :name Return securities with the given text in their name (not case sensitive).
  # @option opts [String] :composite_mic Return securities classified under the composite exchange with the given Market Identification Code (MIC). A composite exchange may or may not be a real exchange.  For example, the USCOMP exchange (our only composite exchange to date) is a combination of exchanges with the following MICs: ARCX, XASE, XPOR, FINR, XCIS, XNAS, XNYS, BATS.  This composite grouping is done for user convenience.  At this time, all US securities are classified under the composite exchange with MIC USCOMP.  To query for specific US exchanges, use the exchange_mic parameter below. 
  # @option opts [String] :exchange_mic The MIC code of the exchange where the security is actually traded.
  # @option opts [Date] :stock_prices_after Return securities with end-of-day stock prices on or after this date.

  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :include_non_figi When true, include securities that do not have a FIGI. By default, this is false. If this parameter is not specified, only securities with a FIGI are returned.
  # @option opts [Integer] :page_size The number of results to return
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :primary_listing If true, the Security is the primary issue for the company, otherwise it is a secondary issue on a secondary stock exchange.  Returns both if omitted.

  # Quote for a Security
  # Returns many popular metrics for a security from multiple products conveniently in one API.

Previous close price and percent change fields require both an EoD US Stock Price subscription and a realtime stock price subscription. Market_cap, price_to_earnings, and dividendyield data fields require a fundamentals subscription.
